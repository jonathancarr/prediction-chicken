# prediction-chicken
Web Application that tracks Mitre 10 Cup team performance and predicts game results.

This application, named after [a fantastic TAB ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3IiX5os8vE), scrapes results from the Mitre 10 Cup website, and predicts the outcomes of upcoming games by analysing past results. 

The back-end for this application is created in Node.js, using the Express.js framework, while the front-end is constructed with the Bootstrap library and EJS templating engine.
